# Code for a Cause - 2021 CECS Accessibility Competition
Your task will be to create an application/service that makes using
video conferencing tools more accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing
community. 

Your application willÂ take in text from a text document or closed
captioning source/service and convert it to video-based ASL. 

Our recommendation is to use Discord or Zoom as your target endpoint, but implementation will be left to your discretion.
